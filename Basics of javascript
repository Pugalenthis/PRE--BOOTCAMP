PRE BOOT-CAMP
DAY -1 

There are three type of variable declaration;

1)var
2)let
3)const

1)VAR 
Var a = 20; Here a variable a is declared and assigned with a value of 20

In VAR we can reassign and redeclare

2)LET
let a = 20;
In let you can't redeclare but you can reassign the value.

3)CONST;
In const yu can't redeclare and reassign.

TYPE CASTING ;
Type casting means changing the type of value from number to string and string to number.

Changing number to string;

To change the type of number to string add empty double quotes after the number.

Let number = 30
number = 30+""
Console.log(type of number) =>string

Changing string to number ;

let name = "guvi"
name = +name
console.log(typeof name)=>number

Console.log(1+1) = 2
Console.log("1+1") = 1+1
Console.log(1+"1") = 11
Console.log(1+10+"1")= 111
Console.log(1+10-"1")= 10

Note; (-) only applicable for numbers.

ARRAY;

Group of elements are called array.

Let array = [1,2,3,4]

TO FIND LENGTH OF ARRAYS;

let array = .[1,2,3,4]
Console.log(array.length)=>4

TO FIND LENGTH OF A STRING;
Let name = "hi this is pugal"
Console.log(name.length)=>16
Space is also counted in finding length of a string.
Console.log(name[5])=>h


TO GET ELEMENTS FROM ARRAY;
Let array = [1,2,3,4,5]
Console.log(variablename[indexnumber])
Console.log(array[0])=>1
Index number always start from the zero

PUSH METHOD;

push method is used to push elements to the array at last index.

Let array =[1,2,3,4,5]
array.push(6)
Console.log(array)=>array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

POP METHOD;

pop method is used to remove element frok the array which is at last index.

Let array = [1,2,3,4,5]
array.pop()
Console.log(array)=>array = [1,2,3,4]

Arrays are also in many lines between commas.

let array = [0,
          "pugal",
                    "be",
                              [4,3,2]]
 console.log(array[3][1])=>3

DAY-2

SPLICE METHOD;

splice method is used to remove specific element and add specific element to the array.

SYNTAX;
variablename.splice(index,count,value to be added)

EXAMPLE;

let array = [1,2,3,4,5]
array.splice(2,1,8)
console.log(array)

OUTPUT;
array = [1,2,8,4,5]

SPLIT METHOD;

Split method is used to convert string into array.

Case:1
let name = "pugal"
console.log(name.split(""))

OUTPUT;
[ 'p', 'u', 'g', 'a', 'l' ]

Case :2
let name = "pugal"
console.log(name.split())

Output;
['pugal']

JOIN METHOD;

Join method is used to convert  to array into string.

Case :1

let array = [ 'p', 'u', 'g', 'a', 'l' ]
console.log(array.join(""))

Output;
pugal

Case :2

let array = [ 'p', 'u', 'g', 'a', 'l' ]
console.log(array.join())

Output;
p,u,g,a,l

IF ELSE CONDITION;

Conditional statements are often used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

IF CONDITION - used to execute a block of code  if condition is true.

ELSE IF CONDITION - used to specify nee condition to test if the first condition(IF CONDITION) is false.

ELSE CONDITION - use to specify block of code to execute after the condition (IF and ELSE IF ) is false.

EXAMPLE;

let age = 18;

if (age>18) {
    console.log("eligible for voting")
    }
    else if(age<=5){
        console.log("under age 5")
        }
        else{
            console.log("you are eligible")
            }
OUTPUT;
you are eligible.

FOR LOOP;

for loop is used to execute the block of code again and again until specified condition is true.

SYNTAX
for(initialisation, condition, increament(or) decrement) {

Code

}

EXAMPLE;

for(i=0;i<5;i++){
    console.log(i)
    }

Output;
0
1
2
3
4

USING FOR LOOP TO PRINT VALUE OF ARRAYS;

let fruits = ["mango","orange","grapes","apple"]

for(i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
    console.log(fruits [i])
    }

OUTPUT;
mango
orange
grapes
apple

OBJECTS;

objects are variables too,but objects can have many values in terms of name:value pairs.

let details = {name : "pugal",
               fname : "sekaran",
                              mname : "chandra"}
               console.log(details.name)

OUTPUT;
pugal
